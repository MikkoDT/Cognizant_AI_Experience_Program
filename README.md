# AI Job Simulation with Cognizant - Gala Groceries Supply Chain Optimization

## Project Overview: 
In this project, I worked on a data science simulation for Cognizant, focusing on optimizing the supply chain for Gala Groceries, a tech-driven grocery store chain in the USA. The business problem centered around the challenge of perishable grocery stock management—balancing overstock and understock situations to reduce waste and maximize customer satisfaction. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), I provided insights and recommendations to address this issue.

### Key Steps:
### 1. Data Preparation:
- Utilized a CSV dataset containing transaction-level sales data from Gala Groceries.
- Loaded the data into Google Colab and processed it using Python’s pandas library.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Statistical Summary: Analyzed key attributes like unit price, quantity sold, and total sales using descriptive statistics (mean, median, count).
- Category Analysis: Identified 22 unique product categories, with top-selling categories like fruits, vegetables, and packaged foods.
- Customer Type Analysis: Segmented sales data by five customer types (non-member, standard, premium, basic, gold), identifying significant customer behavior patterns.
- Demand Analysis: Conducted a product and category-level sales volume analysis to pinpoint which products had the highest demand.
- Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between variables, identifying strong correlations between unit price, quantity, and total sales.

### 3. Visualization:
- Created various visualizations using seaborn to depict distributions of key variables such as total sales, product categories, and customer types.

### 4. Business Recommendations:
- Recommended more granular customer segmentation for targeted promotions.
- Suggested tracking external factors (e.g., seasonal trends, supplier lead times) to improve stock predictions.
- Emphasized the need for integrating real-time IoT sensor data into stock management to dynamically adjust inventory levels.
